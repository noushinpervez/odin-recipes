            <h2>About the recipe:</h2>
            <p align="justify">This recipe is my go-to meal when I just don’t have any time on a busy weekday night, or
                if I can’t think of
                anything to cook…. It pairs
                wonderfully with steamed carrots and broccoli drizzled in a little teriyaki sauce! Just add a good dose
                of
                Japanese rice sprinkled with
                some sesame seeds, and you have a quick, easy, and satisfyingly yummy dinner.</p>
            <p align="justify">I usually use this recipe to make 6 round patties, but you can also divide the meat
                mixture to make 3 oval
                <em>“steaks”</em>.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">Cut it up the leftovers into bite-size pieces, or form the meat mixture into mini
                hamburger patties for a
                great addition to a bento too!</p>
            <p align="justify">Either way you like it, hamburger steak (or, as I call them at home, teriyaki chicken
                burgers) are easy to
                make and do not take any
                particularly unusual ingredients… You should be able to find most of them in your local grocery store,
                and
                if you can’t, there are some
                substitutions you can use as well.</p><br>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol align="justify">
                <li>Heat a pan on medium heat, with 1 tbsp of oil, until shimmering. Add the chopped onion and cook,
                    stirring occasionally, until translucent. Remove from heat and set aside until cooled.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a large bowl, mix together the ground meat, egg, panko, green onion, cooled cooked onion,
                        pepper, and
                        teriyaki sauce. Divide the meat mixture into 6 portions (for round burgers) or 3 portions (for
                        oval
                        <em>“steaks”</em>).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat a pan on medium heat, with 2 tbsp of oil, until shimmering. Using a spoon, gently add the
                        meat
                        mixture to the pan. Mound the meat
                        in the pan and gently use a spatula to pat and flatten into patties. Round burgers should be
                        about 1/2
                        inch thick, and about 3 inches
                        across; oval <em>“steaks”</em> should be about 1 inch thick and 5 inches across.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cook the patties until browned on the bottom, and then flip to cook the second side. Cover with a
                        lid
                        and cook until the juices begin to seep out of the patties, and the hamburger is cooked through.
                        Adjust
                        the heat accordingly in order to avoid burning the meat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Uncover and cook off some of the liquid released by the meat until it is thickened slightly. If
                        you
                        would like more sauce, drizzle more teriyaki sauce on top of the burgers and cook to thicken the
                        sauce. Finish by drizzling unagi sauce onto each burger, about 1-2 tsp per round burger or 1
                        tbsp
                        per oval <em>“steak”</em>.</p>
                    <p>Serve with rice and drizzle the hamburgers with the sauce in the pan.</p>
                </li>
