            <h2>About the recipe:</h2>
            <p align="justify">Chicken nabe is pretty simple to make, though it does require a bit of prep work and some
                specific equipment… namely a portable burner and a low rimmed pot. While nabe is generally cooked in a
                clay or cast iron pot, any low rimmed pot that
                is
                only about 4 inches deep
                will work well too. It’s important to not use a very deep pot because the tall rim will obstruct your
                view
                of the pot’s contents while
                sitting at the table, making reaching for the cooked food difficult.</p>
            <p align="justify">Because chicken nabe is a <em>“one pot dish”</em>, where all the vegetables and meat you
                need are
                included in
                the meal, there’s no need to
                make side dishes or anything to go along with the nabe, except for a little rice, if desired! This makes
                nabe a simple to make meal that
                is really perfect for a family or group dinner. That said, since everything is cooked at the table, it’s
                important to
                <strong>prepare all of your ingredients before hand</strong>
                so that you’re not scrambling to cook and cut vegetables while trying to enjoy your meal.

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol align="justify">
                <li>Fill a low rimmed pot with about 2 inches of dashi stock. Add the konbu and let sit at room
                    temperature
                    for at least an hour, or up to 8 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Prepare your ingredients in the following manner, and set them aside until ready to cook:</p>
                    <p><b>Chicken:</b> Rinse, pat dry, and remove excess fat. Cut into 1.5 inch pieces.</p>
                    <p><b>Napa cabbage:</b> Separate the leaves, wash in cold water, and slice crosswise into 1 inch
                        pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Chrysanthemum greens (or any leafy greens):</b> Wash and cut into 2 inch pieces.</p>
                    <p><b>Japanese green onions:</b> Wash and slice the white parts at a diagonal into 1/4 inch pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Shiitake mushrooms:</b> Wipe clean with a damp paper towel. Cut off the tough or woody ends of
                        the
                        stems, if necessary. Cut an X pattern at the center of the mushroom cap, if desired (this step
                        is
                        pure aesthetic). If using a portobello mushroom, cut into 1/4 inch slices.</p>
                    <p><b>Enoki mushrooms:</b> Cut off the dried bottom portion and separate mushrooms into several
                        small
                        clumps.</p>
                    <p><b>Tofu:</b> Drain of any liquid and cut into 1.5 inch cubes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Bring the pot of dashi stock and konbu to a boil on a portable burner placed at the center of the
                        dining table. Add a portion of
                        the chicken, cabbage, green onions, and tofu to the pot, keeping the items separated from each
                        other
                        and grouped together with their
                        respective types.</p>
                    <img src="../images/chickennabe/chickennabe3.webp" alt="chicken nabe" height="180" width="320"
                        align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
                    <p>Return pot to a simmer, turning the ingredients every so often to ensure the uppermost items are
                        cooked evenly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add leafy greens and mushrooms, and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through and the
                        napa cabbage is soft, about 5 – 8 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Serve by removing desired items from the pot and placing into a small bowl. Pour ponzu or soy
                        sauce
                        over the items (or dip items individually in sauce).</p>
                    <p>When the majority of the items in the pot have been removed, another serving of vegetables and
                        meat can be added. Place the ingredients in groups in the broth and simmer as before until
                        cooked
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Add udon to the empty pot at the end of the meal, cooking the noodles as per the instructions on
                        the package.</p>
