            <h2>About the recipe:</h2>
            <p align="justify">Despite requiring minimal ingredients, pasta carbonara is surprisingly rich, satisfying,
                and flavourful.
                The
                egg is left only partially
                cooked by the hot pasta, which creates a creamy sauce that coats every strand of spaghetti, while the
                guanciale (or pancetta) offers a bit
                of chew as well as small bursts of saltiness.</p>
            <p align="justify">The key to this recipe is having all your ingredients ready to go, so that when your
                pasta is ready, you
                can
                quickly drain it and dump it
                right into the egg mixture. Because this dish relies on the hot pasta on coagulating the raw egg and
                thus
                partially cooking it, it is
                imperative that the pasta is placed immediately into the egg mixture after a quick draining. By only
                coagulating the egg mixture, rather
                than cooking it over direct heat on the stove (which would make the egg become lumpy and scrambled), the
                egg
                remains loose to create a
                creamy sauce that readily coats the pasta.</p><br>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol align="justify">
                <li>Heat a pan on medium heat and fry the guanciale until cooked through. Remove the cooked guanciale
                    from
                    the pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of well salted water to boil, and cook the pasta until al dante.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together egg, olive oil and grated cheese until well
                        incorporated
                        and no egg white is visible. Add pepper to taste.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Drain the cooked pasta, then immediately dump it into the egg mixture. Mix well to coat the hot
                        pasta
                        evenly in the sauce. Add the fried guanciale and toss to combine.</p>
                    <p>Serve the pasta topped with parsley and a slow cooked egg.</p>
                </li>
